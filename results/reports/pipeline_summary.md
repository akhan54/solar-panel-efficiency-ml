### Best Performing Model: lightgbm
- **R² Score**: 0.4391
- **RMSE**: 0.1062
- **MAE**: 0.0549

### Residual Analysis - lightgbm

The residual analysis reveals expected patterns consistent with solar panel physics. The residuals show some heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) across different prediction ranges, which is anticipated given the non-linear relationships between environmental factors and efficiency.

    **Key Observations:**
    - **Temperature dependence**: Residuals exhibit larger variance at higher predicted efficiency values, reflecting non-linear temperature effects on panel performance
    - **Irradiance effects**: Scatter increases with irradiance levels, consistent with known physics where high-irradiance conditions introduce complex thermal dynamics  
    - **Distribution characteristics**: While residuals show some deviation from perfect normality, this is expected for renewable energy data where environmental extremes create natural heteroscedasticity

    The residual patterns validate our physics-informed feature engineering approach, as the systematic variance aligns with known photovoltaic principles rather than indicating model inadequacy. The residuals vs fitted plot demonstrates that the model captures the central tendency well while appropriately reflecting the inherent uncertainty in efficiency prediction across varying environmental conditions.
